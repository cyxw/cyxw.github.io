**ArcTree Official Guide (Work In Progress):**
> *__Stage 1: Before Eternal Core:__*

Beginning of the game. You will have Memory layer first and Light/Dark layers second. All three layers have 12 upgrades, but not all of these upgrade have positive effects. The 11th and 12th upgrades of Memory layer (_Directly Transfer_ and _Conclusion_, M33&M34) have negative nerfs to Fragments and Memories gain, but you have to go buy them to unlock L&D layer.

Once you have bought the 12th upgrades of Memory layer ( _Conclusion_, M34), you will be able to unlock one of two new layers. Each of them is fine, you will unlock another not far away. Light Tachyons boost Fragments generation while Dark Matters boost Memories gain. **The two new layers will be hidden after their reset until the 12th upgrades of Memory layer re-bought and that's intended game design.** That means you cannot buy upgrades and/or regain points immediately after reset.

At this stage, you are likely to gain two kinds of points alternatively, but soon you will find out Light Tachyons gains much faster than Dark Matters. At the first half of L&D layer, if you are stuck at getting one upgrade, go to get more upgrades from the opposite layer. This may happen when you are trying to get the 6th upgrade of Dark layer (_More Darkness_, D22).

Gain much more points before going to buy an upgrade is highly recommended. Because the two layers will be hidden, you progress speed will be very slow if you don't have enough Light Tachyons/Dark Matters stored. Keep pushing until you unlock the 7th upgrade of Dark layer ( _Force Operation_, D23), which needs the 5th upgrade of Light layer (_Seeking Delight._, L21). D23 can force you have M34 upgrade, meaning the two layer no longer hidden but the M34 nerfs also exists. **Gain much more points before buying D23 is strongly recommended,** as you are experiencing M34 nerfs.

After you have bought D23, the game is a little tricky. If you want to earn Light Tachyons this reset, you need to buy M33 to get the Memories gain boost. If you want Dark Matters, you shouldn't buy M33 since it has a Fragments generation speed decrease.

Keep pushing. This stage is grindy and slow. Don't forget to do achievements which have good rewards. Once you bought the last upgrade of both two layers (_The Light_ and _The Dark_, L34&D34), you will see _Eternal Core_ (M41) in Memory layer. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 2: Between Eternal Core and R&F layers:__*

After you bought _Eternal Core_ (M41), the game resets with two new layers shown, but you have to play the whole stage 1 again. This part will be much faster since you have enough achievements and L&D milestones have been unlocked. The second row of achievements will remove M34's nerfs. Keep moving and you will unlock R&F layers quickly.

> *__Stage 3: R&F layers:__*

Red and Forgotten layers are the next layers you are going for. Red layer has several _Happiness Challenges_ (Hc1~Hc9), while Forgotten layer has _Scythe_ and _Beacon_ mechanics. _Happiness Challenges_ are challenges having both positive and negative effects, while _Beacons_ are upgrades beginning from middle, revealed by neighbor upgrades and limited by _Scythes_.

When you first reach these layers, you can choose one of them. Their mechanics are unlocked by the final milestone and you will unlock both of two layer when reaching milestones, so each of them is fine.

 When choosing _Beacons_, keep in mind that there's no point you could be totally stuck. However, among the first eight beacons, _Delightful Memories_ (F22) can boost your progress directly; _Dark Memories_ (F44) can accelerate memories; _Forgotten Memories_ (F42) can let you gain more Forgotten Drops, turning into more _Scythes_ and _Beacons_. Buying them first will make you progress faster. Among the second sixteen beacons, the same strategy still exists. Light-related beacons boost Fragments, Dark-related beacons boost Memories and Forgotten-related beacons boost Forgotten Drops itself. Red-related beacons are not recommended, since Red Dolls' effect is small at this stage.

 What you are going to do here is simple: Do _Happiness Challenges_, buy more _Scythes_ and _Beacons_. Trying to use _Happiness Challenges_' positive effects to farm is useless because things will be reset when quitting Hc. If you are stuck at one Hc, try to change _Beacons_.

 At this stage, the 18th achievement (_Force Balance_, a43) is the most challenging thing you need to do. Guide suggestion is to finish this achievement in Rc2 (_Cracking Softcap_), and turn Light Tachyons autobuyer off if you have. Reset L layer manually for about 3 to 5 times which you may get thousands of Light Tachyons, and hold D hotkey. You may need to try 2 or 3 times if you are unlucky, but you must get this achievement otherwise you cannot push forward without its reward.

 After you finished Rc9 (_Red Comet_), _The Lab_ (M42) will appear in Memory layer. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 4: Lab Part 1-Setup:__*

Lab layer is the first layer of physics route. This layer will never be reset and will be active during the whole game. The first part of Lab layer-Setup upgrades is a tutorial of Lab layer, unlocking its mechanics.

_Researches_ subtab means Lab upgrades. Most of them are powerful and/or QoL like. Setup upgrades will unlock other Lab mechanics.

_Research Progress_ subtab is the achievements in Lab layers. Although there are some rewards, most progress is story-related and has no boosts.You don't need to do them intentionally.

_Research Transformers_ subtab will unlock lots of buyables. This is the main mechanic of Lab layer. You could gain more Research Points and accelerate Research Power generation. At this stage, you are looking for their Research Points reward, since you have few points.

_Milestones_ subtab are milestones which will unlock the effects of transformers, making transformers more useful.

What you need to do at this stage is quite simple: Buy upgrades and transformers, and unlock _Anonymous Effects_ (LAu51).

> *__Stage 5: LC&FL layers and Lab Part 2-Anonymous Researches:__*

Luminous Church layer & Flourish Labyrinth layers are the next main layers of the game. But at this stage, LC&FL layers have no boosts to your progress except some QoL milestones. What you need to focus is still Lab layer. The second part of Lab layer-Anonymous Researches make R&F layer automatic gradually and boost your lab progress greatly. Keep buying upgrades and transformers. Don't forget to get some Luminous Churchs and Flourish Labyrinths. You will finally unlock _The World_ (LAu101), which is the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 6: LC&FL layers, World layer and Lab Part 3-World Researches:__*

World layer is the first layer of mechanic route. This route is designed to restore the original mechanics in original Arcaea game. World layer itself is an idle layer. The progress bar will move at a slow speed and you will gain a World Step if the progress bar is full. The first row of World upgrades will let you cost LC&FL you already gained and you could reach the 4th milestone of both LC&FL, unlocking their mechanics.

LC layer's mechanic is _Zero Sky_. It is a endless challenge where you can gan Glowing Roses. Glowing Roses boost nothing at first, but after you get 100 roses the 30th achievement (_The True Presbyter in The World_, a65) will make Roses boost World Step gain speed. Entering and Exiting _Zero Sky_ will force an LC reset and Roses will reset to zero (or reset half after you get the 35th achievement, _Anthemy_, a75) when you enter, so you need to idle for a long time in _Zero Sky_ if you want more Glowing Roses.

FL layer's mechanic is _Maze_. You will choose one of directions in Maze. Each of four directions has a effect. You cannot choose since Maze gives you only one option at first. But after the 33rd achievement (_Nothing Can Stop Us!_, a73) you will have more options and there's strategy. Moving west is useful only when you want to get more Glowing Roses. Moving north is almost useless at this stage, since it cannot reduce the requirement of gaining LC&FL that much. Moving east itself looks useless, but it is worthable. You can use _Mental Breakdown_ to reset Maze, so that you could use different Maze strategies.

The 9th upgrade of World layer (_Restriction with Possibilities_, W31) will unlock three new types of World Steps. Random Steps means gaining this step will be faster at a random magnification; Fixed Steps means gaining this step will be slower but boosting LC&FL gain permanently after you get through. Restricted Steps is a small challenge, which have rewards boosting Research Points gain. Random and Fixed Steps' probability is 7%, while Restricted Steps' is 1%, so you may idle for a long time to meet them if you are very unlucky.

The _Fall Down_ button in World layer is designed for those who will enduring an extreme long Restricted Step or has too few Fixed Steps and Restricted Steps. Because the Step Height is based on you current World Steps, having less Steps will make you gain new Steps faster. _Fall Down_ won't decrease Fixed Steps and Restricted Steps you have already passed through.

After unlocking all mechanics of these three layers, keep buying upgrades in Lab. Finally, you will _Celebrate Anniversary_ (LAu151), which is the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 7: Between Story layer unlocked and G&K layers:__*

_Celebrate Anniversary_ (LAu151) will unlock Story layer, which reveals the plot of ArcTree game. Story layer itself is simple: you will read stories and each story will return an upgrade. Story upgrades are powerful usually.

Keep reading stories until the 8th upgrade of Story layer (_Exploration_, S23), which will enable you to unlock two new layers: Gemini layer and Knife layer.

> *__Stage 8: G&K layers before Lab Part 4-Fragmental Researches:__*

At the beginning of this stage, you have to choose one of Gemini or Knife layers to unlock. Although their effects have little difference, **unlock Gemini layer first is highly recommended**, because six thousands of World Steps need a lot of time.

Gemini layer has _Gemini Tower_ mechanic. It is same with Balance layer from Prestige Tree. You should set max speed of one progress bar and change to another frequently, so that you could gian Star Point and Moon Point very quickly.

Knife layer has _Memory Adjustment_ mechanic, which are challenges with repetitions. Keep in your mind that _Searching For Essence_ (Kc3), _Rationalism_ (Kc4) and _Otherside of Godess_ (Kc7) are very difficult. You will not finish all five times of them at the end of this stage. _Overhandling Rift_ (Kc6) is the most strategic Kc. Use Beacons related to Light Tachyons/Forgotten Drops, and use Beacons related to Dark Matters if you still can build more Beacons.

Keep pushing _Gemini Tower_ and _Memory Adjustment_ challenges, so that you could meet requirement of new Story updates. Before you reach _Rediscover Fragments_ (S33), you should have already bought all Gemini upgrades and have finished all Kc except Kc3x5, Kc4x5 and Kc7x5.

> *__Stage 9: G&K layers during Lab Part 4-Fragmental Researches:__*

_Rediscover Fragments_ (S33) will unlock the forth part of Lab layer-Fragmental Researches, bringing you back to the Lab. There are new powerful upgrades, enabling you to pass the last Kc.

What you need to do here is simple: buy upgrades. After you have bought all 17 new Fragmental Researches and two new Story upgrades, you will unlock Institution layer. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 10: Institution layer:__*

Things become very crazy in Institution layer. In this layer, you main goal is to get more Institution Funds, so you need to gain more Research Power. At first you only have England site. It's passive but powerful, which you would like to use it in the entire stage. After you unlocked Western European sites, Germany site is recommended because it can boost Research Power greatly and it can be boosted by Poland site. Norway is the thing you will like after unlocking Eastern European sites, but it needs active gaming and quick operation. Before you get the 6th milestone of Institution layer, the strategy below is recommended: 
1. Upgrade your England site as possible as you can.
2. Upgrade Germany second and Poland third.
3. When you almost reach the next Funds, degrade your sites and upgrade Norway as quick as possible.

When you unlocked Asian and American sites, things become more crazy. China site is very strong at Memory & Fragments generation, while USA site is **ultra** strong on everything else. Egypt site itself has a weak effect but USA could boost it to 30x. At this stage, the strategy below is recommended:
* Setup
    1. Upgrade Egypt site as far as you can and upgrade USA site after that.
    2. Gradually switch the grades of Egypt site and USA site.
    3. Degrade all and Upgrade China site as far as you can, then Upgrade USA site second.
    4. Idle for a few seconds.
* Progressing
    1. Degrade all, and upgrade England as far as you can. 
    2. Upgrade Germany site second, Poland third. (If you can't push much Research Power when "England first", try "Germany-Poland combination first" strategy instead.)
    3. Idle for gaining Research Power.
    4. When you **almost** get the next Funds, degrade some and upgrade Norway as fast as you can to get more Institution Funds.

With this strategy, it should be easy for you to get _Efficient Line_ (S41). The next timewall update is _Self Breakthrough_ (S44). Try France site since France can boost Research Point (but not Power) gain. Once you get _Awaken_ (S45) Upgrade, you unlock Awake layer and that's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 11: Awake layer Stage 1-L&D Awake:__*

Like Master layer in PT, Awake layer will let you replay old layers and amplify old layers. The first two awake-able layers are Light and Dark layers. Both of them are fine, but awaking Light layer first is easier because you could keep more Memory upgrades.

After awaken two layers, both layers will unlock four new upgrades, eight in total. All these upgrades needs a challenging requirement. China, France, Germany and Isreal sites will help.

After you bought all new upgrades, you will be able to get the third Awaken Core and that's the end of this stage and current endgame.
